.EXAMPLE Find next Friday in March of 2007
    PS C:\>Get-NthWeekday -Ordinal Next -Day Friday March 2007

        WARNING: Specific months and/or years are ignored when finding a specific weekday or the next occurrence of a weekday

        Friday, March 16, 2018

    This command finds next Friday.
    NOTE - The current month and year is always used when searching for the Next or Every
        weekday. If they are included in the command, they will be ignored!

.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\>(Get-NthWeekday -Ordinal 2 -WeekDay Wednesday -Month June -Year 2016).AddDays(-1)

        Tuesday, June 7, 2016

    This command gets the the Tuesday before the second Wednesday in June 2016

.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\>Get-NthWeekday -Ordinal 2 -WeekDay Tuesday -Month 6 -Year 2016

        Tuesday, June 14, 2016

    This command gets the second Tuesday of June 2016
    If you compare this to the previous example, you can see that the second Tuesday is actually
    different than the day before the second Wednesday

            I do not remember why I had added this, but to fix it, I will need to go through all of my other scripts.
            The $WeekDay parameter already defaults to the current day of the week, so this will most likely be removed
                or at least renamed to 'Current'. Again, that depends on if I can find a use case for it.
